<h2>Currently work in progress</h2>
<h1>Oliver's Pronunciation Library</h1>
<p>This is a collection of <b>japanese</b> pronuciation audio files specifically made to cover words, phrases and onomatopoeia that JapanesePod101 doesn't (such as 大貧民, 伝家の宝刀, and ぴくぴく). It can be used with <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net">Anki</a>, and can also be hooked up to <a href="https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan">Yomichan</a>.</p>
<p>This is self-curated and only covers words I've personally found during my learning journey that have not already been covered by JapanesePod101 (with some exceptions). Therefore <b>it is far from comprehensive</b>, and should only be used along-side a more comprehensive library, such as JapanesePod101 or Jisho.</p>
<p>Most, if not all pronunciations here are derived from <a href="https://forvo.com">Forvo</a> and have been modified to be more suitable for use.
  <br>Edits involve noise-cancelling, trimming, timing, compression and equalisation where applicable. Basically, these audio files are far more consistent in quality. Note that all audio files generally peak around -6dB.
